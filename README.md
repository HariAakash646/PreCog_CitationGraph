# PreCog_CitationGraphAnalysis
Repository containing all my files and reports for the Citation Grph Analysis task.

## Analysis
The cells of the .ipynb file can be run in order to view all th plots. A few lines of code can be toggled between commented/uncommented to include/exclude nodes with no dates. If the nodes are included, a date greater than the maximum date in the graph is assigned to them.

## Node2Vec
This folder contans the .ipynb file to train the node embeddings. The cells of this file can be run in order. It is ideal for the .ipynb notebook to run on a GPU.
